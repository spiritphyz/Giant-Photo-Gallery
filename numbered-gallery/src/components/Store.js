      description: 'The easiest way to test your technique is by using a pipette with an analytical balance. Pipette deionized water into a tared container on the balance to check your accuracy and reproducibility. One-thousand microliters of water weighs about 1,000 milligrams, which can be easily measured on an analytical balance.',
